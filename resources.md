**On Git and Github**

Version Control is imperative to keeping track of changes in the code. Git is a very popular version control system, and can be easily used with RStudio. [Github](https://github.com) is a website that provides powerful integration with Git, and allows easy sharing of the code with others.

 **On Writing**
 
Any brilliant idea can be killed by horrible writing. Fortunately, good writing can be learned and there are numeruous resources out there to help. If you are a TAMU student, then you may want to consult

If you would like to read a book, then personally I found the following two useful:
 - [How to Write a Lot, Paul Silva](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive/dp/1591477433)
 - [Becoming an Academic Writer, Patricia Goodson](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Academic-Writer-Exercises-Productive/dp/1452203865)
 
 Some of the advices in these books are specific to Psychology, but the majority carries through to pretty much any subject.
