**On Git and Github**

Version Control is imperative to keeping track of changes in the code. Git is a very popular version control system, and can be easily used with RStudio. [Github](https://github.com) is a website that provides powerful integration with Git, and allows easy sharing of the code with others. A nice intro by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) including RStudio integration is [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html), and another short guide on [Udacity](http://blog.udacity.com) with further resources is [here](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html).
