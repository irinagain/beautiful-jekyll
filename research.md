# Summary of research interests:

* high-dimensional data analysis
* multivariate analysis
* statistical methods for analyzing biological data
* machine learning
* computational statistics


My research interests are at the intersection of applied, computational and theoretical statistics. I believe that challenging applied problems give rise to better statistical methodology and my primary goal is to aid the discovery of scientifically meaningful low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional data. I believe that collaboration plays a key role in achieving this goal and I enjoy working with both domain scientists and methodological researchers.

My methodological interests are in the areas of multivariate analysis, machine learning and computational statistics. The classical multivariate analysis tools, which can be used for the analysis of variance (principal components), classification (discriminant analysis) or network recovery (canonical correlation), perform poorly when applied to modern datasets due to the presence of spurious correlations and over-selection of relevant features. I am interested in addressing these problems jointly in the high-dimensional settings by developing new statistical methodology that is both computationally efficient and theoretically sound. I have found that penalization techniques and the tools of convex optimization are particularly useful in achieving this goal.

I have worked on a variety of applied problems such as classification of leukemia patients based on DNA methylation profiles, control of false discovery rates in sample size calculations and study of antibiotic molecular actions based on the metabolic profiles. My methodological work has been strongly motivated by these applied projects and I am looking forward to new collaborations in the future.
